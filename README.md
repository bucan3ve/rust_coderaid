# Super Competitive 4-Digit Code Generator

This is the pinnacle of code-generating technology. It's so advanced, so cutting-edge, that it's almost...stupid. We've poured countless (well, a few) hours into developing the ultimate list of 4-digit codes, designed for the most competitive of situations. You know, like when you're trying not to get raided in Rust.

## The Story

Imagine you're in a life-or-death (well, in-game) situation. You've built your base, and now you need a 4-digit code that nobody (or at least, *almost nobody*) can guess. You can't just use `1234` or `0000`, that's just asking for trouble. You need to think like a devious, code-obsessed mastermind who also has a tendency to think about years and common key sequences, and a bit of randomness.

## How It Works (The Stupid Version)

This Python tool uses a very, very complex (and slightly absurd) scoring system to generate a list of 4-digit codes, ordered by how likely they are to be chosen by someone who's desperately trying *not* to be guessed. We consider things like:

*   **Sequential Patterns:** We know those are easy targets. (Penalized heavily)
*   **Repeating Digits:** Same as above. (Also, penalized)
*   **Birth Years (1990-2010):** People love those old nostalgic years, they tend to use parts of them. (Slight bonus)
*   **Keypad Patterns:** Some are easier to visualize, some are just confusing as hell. (Mixed scores based on complexity)
*   **Complex Sequences:** We will score complex sequences of different number with more values (High Score)
*   **And Much More:** Seriously, it's a lot of rules, all designed to give you the most competitive list.

This generator is able to output a list of codes that try to mix some "smart" way of thinking, a good balance between easy to remember, and hard to guess.

## How to Run This Thing

1.  **Make sure you have Python installed.** If you don't, Google it. Seriously, I'm not going to help you with that.
2.  **Grab the `code_generator.py` file.** You know, the one with all the code in it.
3.  **Open your terminal (or command prompt).**
4.  **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the Python file.
5.  **Type:** `python code_generator.py` and press Enter.
6.  **Two files will be generated**: `codes_competitive.txt`.
7.  **Open `codes_competitive.txt`** in any text editor, and BAM! There you have it, the list of codes.

## The `codes_competitive.txt` File

The generated `codes_competitive.txt` file contains the ordered list of code. This list is the ultimate answer, ordered from the one code that people would choose to use in the most competitive scenario to the less probable ones.

## Example

Here are the first codes in the `codes_competitive.txt` you would probably see as of today:
